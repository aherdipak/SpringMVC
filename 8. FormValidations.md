## Form Validations 01 (using JSR 303/349 provided annotations)

### Question 1: 
#### whatever value provided in a student hobby field that values minimum length of 2 chars and never exceeds 30 chars and if the user violates this rule at a time of submitting the form then my spring application return the same form back to the client with a complete description of the violated rule, How to achieve such things?

##### \Student.java
```
public class Student {

	private String studentName;
	
	@Size(min=2,max=30) // with this annotation on top of this field 
	// WE simply conveing msg 
	// hey spring mvc framework whenever you performing data bainding task
	// for studenthobby field and the value which is bing with it 
	// value having less than 2 and more than 30 then you simply treet that as data binding error and put that into Databiding eror ref
	// To activate this annotation you have put @Valid annotation in controoler before @ModelAttribute
	private String studenthobby;
	
	private Long mobileNumber;
	private Date dob;
	private List<String> skills;
	
	private Address studentAddress;
	
	// getter & setter
}
```
##### \FormValidationController.java
```
@Controller
public class FormValidationController {
	
	
	@RequestMapping(value="/getStudentAdmissionFormPage.htm", method=RequestMethod.GET)
	public ModelAndView getStudentAdmissionFormPage() {
		ModelAndView modelAndView = new ModelAndView("studentAdmissionForm");
		modelAndView.addObject("headerMsg", "Enginnering College,India");
		return modelAndView;
	}
	//@Valid
	// with this annotation we simply instructing spring mvc framework
	// hey speing mvc framework whenever you performing data binding task for this student obj
	// its only that time you consider all those form validation related annotation which are kept in student class 
	// so idea is very clear if we put @Valid here then and only then sprin mvc framework will consider form validation annotations
	// if we dont put @Valid thenspring mvc completely ignore form validation anotations kept in student class
	@RequestMapping(value="/submitStudentAdmissionForm.htm", method=RequestMethod.POST)
	public ModelAndView submitStudentAdmissionForm(@Valid @ModelAttribute("student") Student student, BindingResult result) {
		
		if(result.hasErrors()) {
			ModelAndView modelAndView = new ModelAndView("studentAdmissionForm");
			return modelAndView;
		}
		
		ModelAndView modelAndView = new ModelAndView("admissionSuccessNew");
		
		modelAndView.addObject("headerMsg", "Enginnering College,India");
		modelAndView.addObject("msg", "Form Submitted by Name: "+ student.getStudentName() +" Hobby: "+student.getStudenthobby());
		
		return modelAndView;
	}

}

```
