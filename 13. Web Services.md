## Web Services 01 (Introduction to SOAP Web Service)

#### Webservice fundamentals:

##### what is a web service?

###### In simple words, it's all about developing a software application in such a way that it can allow other software applications to make a call to its methods.

Suppose we have a web service application which has exposed `method1()` and `method2()` these two methods.

Then any other software application developed using any language can make a call to these methods. 

An application which makes a call to methods of a web service application is in general known as a `**Client application**`, and web service application itself is in general known as a `**Service provider**`.

##### Important points:

1. Client and service provider may or may not be developed using the same programming language. so it may happen a service provider is developed using Java and its client is developed using c,c# or any other programming language.

2. Client and service provider may or may not be present on the same machine 
if both are present on different machine say `machine1(m1)` and `machine2(m2)`
then there has to be some network connecting them, for example, a `LAN`, a `WAN`,  `internet` or some other network.
