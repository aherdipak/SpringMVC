## Web Services 01 (Introduction to SOAP Web Service)

#### Webservice fundamentals:

##### what is a web service?

###### In simple words, it's all about developing a software application in such a way that it can allow other software applications to make a call to its methods.

Suppose we have a web service application which has exposed `method1()` and `method2()` these two methods.

Then any other software application developed using any language can make a call to these methods. 

An application which makes a call to methods of a web service application is in general known as a **Client application**, and web service application itself is in general known as a **Service provider**.

##### Important points:

1. Client and service provider may or may not be developed using the same programming language. so it may happen a service provider is developed using Java and its client is developed using c,c# or any other programming language.

2. Client and service provider may or may not be present on the same machine 
if both are present on different machine say `machine1(m1)` and `machine2(m2)`
then there has to be some network connecting them, for example, a `LAN`, a `WAN`,  `internet` or some other network.

#### Guy's every software is developed by following certain standard rules:

###### In a similar manner, A Web service application is developed by following certain standard rules.

If a developer follows all rules as specified in SOAP protocol while developing a web service application then that application will be called as a **SOAP-based** web service application.and If we follow all rules as specified in REST Guidelines then that application will be called as a **REST-based** web service application.


let's first understand the working of a SOAP-based web service application with the help of a real-life analogy.

In the real world what all basic information a person needs for ordering pizza at home.
firstly he would need to know about the phone no. / mobile no. of the pizza store. 
secondly, he would need to know about all pizza options are available with there prices and some more related information.

Here the person ordering the pizza is a client and the pizza store is the service provider. usually, the client gets all such information through the client's website or brochure so once he has all the details he can happily make a phone call to the pizza store guy and place an order.

An important point to note here is without all such info client can not utilize the service offered by the pizza store. in a similar manner programming world too. The client has to know about certain basic info about the web service application without which he can not make a call to any of its method. basic info like the exact location of it. you know the `IP address` and `PORT number` where that application is running. The exact signature of the method which that web service application has opened for other application and other related info.
