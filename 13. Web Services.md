## Web Services 01 (Introduction to SOAP Web Service)

#### Webservice fundamentals:

##### what is a web service?

###### In simple words, it's all about developing a software application in such a way that it can allow other software applications to make a call to its methods.

Suppose we have a web service application which has exposed `method1()` and `method2()` these two methods.

Then any other software application developed using any language can make a call to these methods. 

An application which makes a call to methods of a web service application is in general known as a **Client application**, and web service application itself is in general known as a **Service provider**.

##### Important points:

1. Client and service provider may or may not be developed using the same programming language. so it may happen a service provider is developed using Java and its client is developed using c,c# or any other programming language.

2. Client and service provider may or may not be present on the same machine 
if both are present on different machine say `machine1(m1)` and `machine2(m2)`
then there has to be some network connecting them, for example, a `LAN`, a `WAN`,  `internet` or some other network.

#### Guy's every software is developed by following certain standard rules:

###### In a similar manner, A Web service application is developed by following certain standard rules.

If a developer follows all rules as specified in SOAP protocol while developing a web service application then that application will be called as a **SOAP-based** web service application.and If we follow all rules as specified in REST Guidelines then that application will be called as a **REST-based** web service application.


let's first understand the working of a SOAP-based web service application with the help of a real-life analogy.

In the real world what all basic information a person needs for ordering pizza at home.
firstly he would need to know about the phone no. / mobile no. of the pizza store. 
secondly, he would need to know about all pizza options are available with there prices and some more related information.

Here the person ordering the pizza is a client and the pizza store is the service provider. usually, the client gets all such information through the client's website or brochure so once he has all the details he can happily make a phone call to the pizza store guy and place an order.

An important point to note here is without all such info client can not utilize the service offered by the pizza store. in a similar manner programming world too. The client has to know about certain basic info about the web service application without which he can not make a call to any of its method. basic info like the exact location of it. you know the `IP address` and `PORT number` where that application is running. The exact signature of the method which that web service application has opened for other application and other related info.

The idea is the developer puts all such info. of his web service application in a file in an XML format and provide it to all users who want their application to utilize services offered by his web service application.

So once the client has this file he can happily make a call to methods of that web service application.

This file which contains all basic info of his specific web service application is very popularly known with the name of  `WSDL(Web serviceDescription Language)` file.


### Question:
#### How does the client get this information?


Guy's in this real-life analogy both client and service provider(pizza store guy) make sure when they communicate over phone, they both speak in language in a format which both can understand.

let's say here both agree to communicate in the English language which using English grammar format.

In the similar manner when a client makes a call to the method of a web service application and web service application intern sends a response back to the client both communicate to each other using soap format(SOAP Protocol).

Exact the way here in above real-life analogy client and pizza store guy use the English grammar format to communicate with each other. Here the client and service provider use SOAP protocol to communicate with each other.

SOAP protocol says communication between two software should happen in an XML format by following certain rules.

Important  point to note here is client and service provider both communicate to each other  using SOAP protocol and as result service provider application is termed as a `SOAP based web service application` and its client is termed as a `SOAP-based client`.
  
SOAP-based web service application and its client most commonly use `HTTP` as the protocol while sending messages to each other. over a network, they can use other protocol too instead of `HTTP` like `SMTP`, `FTP`, `JMS` etc as per the requirements.

### Question:
#### What's a RESTful Web Service?


If your software application exposes its data to other software applications And while doing so if it follows all guidelines as specified in rest, then that application is known as `RESTful application` Or simply a `REST based application`.

Guys, whatever api's or uri's a rest based application provides using which other application Can access or modify its data are informally known as `REST api's`.

#### So the Question is: 

#### HOW DO WE DEVELOP SUCH AN APPLICATION? 
Which keeps other applications an ability to access or modify its data in super easy and effective manner.

And here comes REST guidelines into the picture :- 

`REST --> Representational State Transfer`

It's basically a set of guidelines which describes the overall architecture of such an application. 

#### Guidelines:

REST says a client and server architecture whatever data or functionality Is kept at the server application which client can access or modify is known as `Resource`.

So they can be 1,2,100,1000 or any no of resources present at the server application Which client has an access too.

A client can access or modify any of their Resource present at the server application using its URI.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35020560/58941579-b650b780-8799-11e9-9be9-bcc86e5472b4.png)

So here is how it works: -

- The client sends a req to the server to access Resource using it are as provided by the server. 
- And server sends a response back to the client. 
- The response which the client receives as actually a there representation of Resource Means its actual copy of the requested            Resource in any of the specific formats Like xml, json, html, csv, pdf, etc. as requested by the client.

In addition to the representation of requested Resource the response also contains some additional info.
Characteristic of this representation? Like its which describes every basic charectoristics of this representation
like its formats, size etc. etc. 

So apon receiving response just by analyzing the additional info. the client will come to known 
about all basic info. it may required while processing the representation of requested Resource received in that response.
