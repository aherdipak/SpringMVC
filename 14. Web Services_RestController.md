## Web Services 02 (@RestController annotation)


Guys everything is perfect with `StudentAdmissionController.java` class except one point.
Which is bothering me a lot, which is making me a little uncomfortable as a developer.
And the point is here we have mixed two kinds of controller methods in one controller class. 

One kind of controller methods which are annotated with the @ResponseBody annotation means these controller methods are associated with REST API concepts. and the other kind of controller methods which are non @ResponseBody annotated controller method means these controller methods are not associated with REST API concepts.

So if you're going to mix these kind of controller methods in a single controller class, then you are going to create a lot of confusion for developers who are going to work with such kind of projects, because it becomes very challenging for developers to manage controller classes having mix of these kind of controller methods.

So it is always advisable to separate them out in separate controller classes.


So what you should do, you should maintain a separate controller classes for all @ResponseBody annotated controller methods and  separate controller classes which have non @ResponseBody annotated controller methods that way you are definitely going to improve the readability of the controller classes in your sprinMVC project.


##### /RestApiController.java
```

@Controller
public class RestApiController {

	//************* Retrieving All students records ***************************
	
	 @ResponseBody // to convert java object to JSON String 
	 @RequestMapping(value= "/student", method=RequestMethod.GET)
	 public List<Student> getStudentList(){

	   Student std1 = new Student("Mahatma gandhi");
	   Student std2 = new Student("Vivek");
	   Student std3 = new Student("Narendra"); 
	   Student std4 = new Student("Amit"); 

	   List<Student> list = new ArrayList();
	   list.add(std1);
	   list.add(std2);
	   list.add(std3);
	   list.add(std4);
	   return list;
	 }
	 
	 //************* Retrieving  student record ****************************
	 @ResponseBody  
	 @RequestMapping(value= "/student/{name}", method=RequestMethod.GET)
	 public Student getStudent(@PathVariable("name") String studentName) {
		 
		 // fetch the student's record using studentName from the DB
		 Student student = new Student();
		 student.setName(studentName);
		 student.setHobby("WWE");
		 System.out.println(studentName);
		 return student;
	 }
	
}
```

#### @RestController :

Spring framework suggests for such kind of controller class which are only going to contain `@ResponseBody` annotated controller Methods use `@RestController` annotation instead of `@Controller` annotation.

##### What purpose it serves?

It just indicates spring framework that whatever methods you have included inside such a controller class all such controller methods are basically Related to REST API so any of the method if you are going to include in such controller class You are not required to explicitly specify `@ResponseBody` annotation at the top.


##### /RestApiController.java
```
@RestController
public class RestApiController {

	 @RequestMapping(value= "/student", method=RequestMethod.GET)
	 public List<Student> getStudentList(){

	   Student std1 = new Student("Mahatma gandhi");
	   Student std2 = new Student("Vivek");
	   Student std3 = new Student("Narendra"); 
	   Student std4 = new Student("Amit"); 

	   List<Student> list = new ArrayList();
	   list.add(std1);
	   list.add(std2);
	   list.add(std3);
	   list.add(std4);
	   return list;
	 }
	 
	 @RequestMapping(value= "/student/{name}", method=RequestMethod.GET)
	 public Student getStudent(@PathVariable("name") String studentName) {
		 
		 // fetch the student's record using studentName from the DB
		 Student student = new Student();
		 student.setName(studentName);
		 student.setHobby("WWE");
		 System.out.println(studentName);
		 return student;
	 }
}


```

## Web Services - POSTMAN (Rest API testing tool)

So far we use the browser as a testing tool. By default browser make HTTP GET type of request by default On that REST API.

#### Question:
Now if we develop kind of REST API which demands clients to make POST request for that HTTP POST kind of requests or HTTP DELETE kind of request or any other HTTP kind of request other than GET the type of request for them So the question is how to test such kind of complex REST API?

We can not test such kind of request using the standard browser tool because the standard browser tool would allow you to test those REST API which demands clients to make a `GET` type of request only.

In market so many sophisticated REST API testing tools are available like `SOAP UI, Restlet Client, POSTMAN` etc.
So its very difficult to comment on which tool is better over another one because every tool have got some feature in it which distinguish it from counterparts, but still I suggest to go with postman maybe because it's so simpler in comparison to others for carrying out with the testing task for development of rest API.

##### Let's install postman :

you can install in your system or add extension to the crome browser.

## Web Services - POSTMAN (JSON & XML Response)

Guys, so far we have been supporting only one format and that is JSON for these REST API. and now what we want?
We want to support one more format and that is an `XML` format in addition to `JSON` format for this REST API's.

Guys, when we supported JSON format in these REST API's what are the steps we ware performed, The only step which we performed was to include these (Jackson-annotations.jar, Jackson-core.jar, Jackson-databind.jar) three jar's add on to the class path of this project. means we included these three jars under lib folder/include in pom.xml file of this spring project and we were done. So after that step spring MVC framework automatically started supporting JSON format for these REST API's.

Now we want to support `XML` format exactly the same kind of steps we need to perform for that we have to download bellow jars files. and we have to include these jars under the lib folder/include in pom.xml file in spring proect. then after spring application automatically support XMl format.

```markdown

1. jackson-dataformat-xml.jar

This jar is further depends on some jar's for this jar to work properly we have to download those jars as well

2. jackson-core.jar         // already included for JOSN response
3. jackson-annotations.jar  // already included for JOSN response
4. jackson-databind.jar      // already included for JOSN response
5. jackson-module-jaxb-annotations.jar
6. woodstox-core.jar
7. stax2-api.jar

```

Now our `REST API` controller methods become ready to support `JSON` format as well as `XML` format, so in what format it's going to prepare and send the response.

When a REST API controller method supports more than one format, then it's the client's responsibility to specify along with the request in what format it want to view the response. So here in this case client need to specify in what format it wants server response `JSON` format or `XML` format and how it can send that info along with the request?

well it has to attach a header with the key `Accept` along with the request to the server like bellow.

## Web Services - (@RequestMapping using produces)


#### Question: 

How to restrict a specific REST API controller method? To support any one format so it could be the case that your application are supporting more than one formats like in our application, We are supporting `XML` and `JSON` but what if we want a specific REST API controller method to support only one format not more than one format So how to achieve that?

So that can be achieved by making use of `produces` argument to request mapping annotation.

```
  @RequestMapping(value= "/student", method=RequestMethod.GET,produces=MediaType.APPLICATION_XML_VALUE)
  public List<Student> getStudentList(){

	   Student std1 = new Student("Mahatma gandhi");
	   Student std2 = new Student("Vivek");
	   Student std3 = new Student("Narendra"); 
	   Student std4 = new Student("Amit"); 

	   List<Student> list = new ArrayList();
	   list.add(std1);
	   list.add(std2);
	   list.add(std3);
	   list.add(std4);
	   return list;
 }
 
```

If we put `produces=MediaType.APPLICATION_XML_VALUE` in RequestMapping annotation them we are here forcing spring MVC that this REST API controller method must support only one format and that format is `XML`.

If I change its value from `XML` to `JSON` in that case it's going to support only `JSON`.

```
 @RequestMapping(value= "/student/{name}", method=RequestMethod.GET,produces=MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
  public Student getStudent(@PathVariable("name") String studentName) {
		 
	 // fetch the student's record using studentName from the DB
	 Student student = new Student();
	 student.setName(studentName);
	 student.setHobby("WWE");
	 System.out.println(studentName);
	 return student;
}

```
