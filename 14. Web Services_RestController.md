## Web Services 02 (@RestController annotation)


Guys everything is perfect with `StudentAdmissionController.java` class except one point.
Which is bothering me a lot, which is making me a little uncomfortable as a developer.
And the point is here we have mixed two kinds of controller methods in one controller class. 

One kind of controller methods which are annotated with the @ResponseBody annotation means these controller methods are associated with REST API concepts. and the other kind of controller methods which are non @ResponseBody annotated controller method means these controller methods are not associated with REST API concepts.

So if you're going to mix these kind of controller methods in a single controller class, then you are going to create a lot of confusion for developers who are going to work with such kind of projects, because it becomes very challenging for developers to manage controller classes having mix of these kind of controller methods.

So it is always advisable to separate them out in separate controller classes.


So what you should do, you should maintain a separate controller classes for all @ResponseBody annotated controller methods and  separate controller classes which have non @ResponseBody annotated controller methods that way you are definitely going to improve the readability of the controller classes in your sprinMVC project.


##### /RestApiController.java
```

@Controller
public class RestApiController {

	//************* Retrieving All students records ***************************
	
	 @ResponseBody // to convert java object to JSON String 
	 @RequestMapping(value= "/student", method=RequestMethod.GET)
	 public List<Student> getStudentList(){

	   Student std1 = new Student("Mahatma gandhi");
	   Student std2 = new Student("Vivek");
	   Student std3 = new Student("Narendra"); 
	   Student std4 = new Student("Amit"); 

	   List<Student> list = new ArrayList();
	   list.add(std1);
	   list.add(std2);
	   list.add(std3);
	   list.add(std4);
	   return list;
	 }
	 
	 //************* Retrieving  student record ****************************
	 @ResponseBody  
	 @RequestMapping(value= "/student/{name}", method=RequestMethod.GET)
	 public Student getStudent(@PathVariable("name") String studentName) {
		 
		 // fetch the student's record using studentName from the DB
		 Student student = new Student();
		 student.setName(studentName);
		 student.setHobby("WWE");
		 System.out.println(studentName);
		 return student;
	 }
	
}
```

#### @RestController :

Spring framework suggests for such kind of controller class which are only going to contain `@ResponseBody` annotated controller Methods use `@RestController` annotation instead of `@Controller` annotation.

##### What purpose it serves?

It just indicates spring framework that whatever methods you have included inside such a controller class all such controller methods are basically Related to REST API so any of the method if you are going to include in such controller class You are not required to explicitly specify `@ResponseBody` annotation at the top.


##### /RestApiController.java
```
@RestController
public class RestApiController {

	 @RequestMapping(value= "/student", method=RequestMethod.GET)
	 public List<Student> getStudentList(){

	   Student std1 = new Student("Mahatma gandhi");
	   Student std2 = new Student("Vivek");
	   Student std3 = new Student("Narendra"); 
	   Student std4 = new Student("Amit"); 

	   List<Student> list = new ArrayList();
	   list.add(std1);
	   list.add(std2);
	   list.add(std3);
	   list.add(std4);
	   return list;
	 }
	 
	 @RequestMapping(value= "/student/{name}", method=RequestMethod.GET)
	 public Student getStudent(@PathVariable("name") String studentName) {
		 
		 // fetch the student's record using studentName from the DB
		 Student student = new Student();
		 student.setName(studentName);
		 student.setHobby("WWE");
		 System.out.println(studentName);
		 return student;
	 }
}


```

## Web Services - POSTMAN (Rest API testing tool)

So far we use the browser as a testing tool. By default browser make HTTP GET type of request by default On that REST API.

#### Question:
Now if we develop kind of REST API which demands clients to make POST request for that HTTP POST kind of requests or HTTP DELETE kind of request or any other HTTP kind of request other than GET the type of request for them So the question is how to test such kind of complex REST API?

We can not test such kind of request using the standard browser tool because the standard browser tool would allow you to test those REST API which demands clients to make a `GET` type of request only.

In market so many sophisticated REST API testing tools are available like `SOAP UI, Restlet Client, POSTMAN` etc.
So its very difficult to comment on which tool is better over another one because every tool have got some feature in it which distinguish it from counterparts, but still I suggest to go with postman maybe because it's so simpler in comparison to others for carrying out with the testing task for development of rest API.

##### Let's install postman :

you can install in your system or add extension to the crome browser.
