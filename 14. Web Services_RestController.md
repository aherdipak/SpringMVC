## Web Services 02 (@RestController annotation)


Guys everything is perfect with `StudentAdmissionController.java` class except one point.
Which is bothering me a lot, which is making me a little uncomfortable as a developer.
And the point is here we have mixed two kinds of controller methods in one controller class. 

One kind of controller methods which are annotated with the @ResponseBody annotation means these controller methods are associated with REST API concepts. and the other kind of controller methods which are non @ResponseBody annotated controller method means these controller methods are not associated with REST API concepts.

So if you're going to mix these kind of controller methods in a single controller class, then you are going to create a lot of confusion for developers who are going to work with such kind of projects, because it becomes very challenging for developers to manage controller classes having mix of these kind of controller methods.

So it is always advisable to separate them out in separate controller classes.


So what you should do, you should maintain a separate controller classes for all @ResponseBody annotated controller methods and  separate controller classes which have non @ResponseBody annotated controller methods that way you are definitely going to improve the readability of the controller classes in your sprinMVC project.
