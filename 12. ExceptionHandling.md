## Exception Handling 01

Refer Example : SpringMVC_ExceptionHandling

In general what happens when your springMVC application throws some ```xyz``` Exception without any code to handle that.

Let's check it out.

When a user request for this url ```http://localhost:8081/SpringMVC_ExceptionHandling/getStudentAdmissionFormPage.htm```

The belove method in AdmissionController class gets executed and webpage sends to the user As a response.

```
@RequestMapping(value="/getStudentAdmissionFormPage.htm", method=RequestMethod.GET)
public ModelAndView getStudentAdmissionFormPage() {
	ModelAndView modelAndView = new ModelAndView("studentAdmissionForm");
	modelAndView.addObject("headerMsg", "Enginnering College,India");
	return modelAndView;
}
```
And if everything goes fine on server while processing this request user will get `studentAdmissionForm` webpage as a response.

Now, due to some developer mistake or some other reason if while processing the request, request handling method throws some exception, say NullPointerException, ResourceNotFoudound or any other. what's gonna happen? What user wanna gets In that case as a response?

As example: 

Bellow method throws NullPointerException for above URL request.

```
	@RequestMapping(value="/getStudentAdmissionFormPage.htm", method=RequestMethod.GET)
	public ModelAndView getStudentAdmissionFormPage() {
		
		String exceptionOccured = "NULL_POINTER";
		if(exceptionOccured.equalsIgnoreCase("NULL_POINTER")) {
			throw new NullPointerException("Null Pointer Exception");
		}
		
		ModelAndView modelAndView = new ModelAndView("studentAdmissionForm");
		modelAndView.addObject("headerMsg", "Enginnering College,India");
		return modelAndView;
	}
	 
```

Important point to notice No here in this code I am not handling NullPointerException.

Now I would request for admission form.
What's gonna happen, what I would get as a response?
It has sent bellow error page

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35020560/57191396-b82d1e00-6f42-11e9-8c35-76181911bdd0.png)


On this page its talking about two imp points.
On top it has mention HTTP Status code 500,Then the brief description of the error which occurred on the server.

Normally when any exception occurs for which there is no exception handling code return in the controller class Then the application by default sends an error page like above image.

Now many times developers would like to send customized error web page Instead of this default error page which doesn't seem so much user friendly.

### Question 1: 

#### So the question is what task I need to perform in this application so that I would be able to send customized Error webpage when this method would throw null pointer exception while processing the request?

Guy's to tackle with this requirement I just need to perform these two simple steps And I will be done.


```markdown
1. Include a JSP page NullPointerException.jsp
2. Include a method with @ExceptionHandler annotation on its top as shown below:

@ExceptionHandler(value = NullPointerException.class)
public String handleNullPointerException(Exception e){

// logging Null Pointer Exception
System.out.println("Null Pointer Exception Occured: "+e);

return "NullPointerException";


}

```

When user request to the Admission Form page this request handling method throw NullPointerException and And immediately after that springmvc framework started looking for a method In the same controller class which has an `@ExceptionHandler` annotation on top of it and value as `NullPointerException.class`

##### /NullPointerException.jsp

```
<%@ taglib prefix="form" uri="http://www.springframework.org/tags/form" %>
<%@ taglib prefix="spring" uri="http://www.springframework.org/tags" %>
<html>
<head>
<title>success</title>
</head>
<body>

	<h1>${headerMsg}</h1>
	<h1>STUDENT ADMISSION FORM FOR ENGINEERING COURSE</h1>
	
	<p>The application has encountered a Null Pointer error. Please contact support by sending an email at webmaster@dac.com</p>

</body>
</html>

```


Some important point to notice:

This controller class we are handling only NullPointerException So if request handling method throws any other exception at runtime while processing The request like IoException, ArthmeticException means exception for which We have not put any exception handler method the application gonna send the default Error webpage to the user as a response as we sow in a NullPointerException

```
@ExceptionHandler(value = IOException.class)
public String handleIoException(Exception e){
	System.out.println("IO Exception Occured: "+e);
	return "IOException";
}

```

##### /IOException.jsp

```
<%@ taglib prefix="form" uri="http://www.springframework.org/tags/form" %>
<%@ taglib prefix="spring" uri="http://www.springframework.org/tags" %>
<html>
<head>
<title>success</title>
</head>
<body>

	<h1>${headerMsg}</h1>
	<h1>STUDENT ADMISSION FORM FOR ENGINEERING COURSE</h1>
	
	<p>The application has encountered a Input Output error. Please contact support by sending an email at webmaster@dac.com</p>

</body>
</html>
```

Now the important point to not here is your controller class might throw a lot off Exceptions at runtime and it may not convenient so to write exception handler method For each exception.

### Question 2:
#### So to tackle such a problem what we do, we can add a generic exception handling method In this controller class, such that when this controller class throws some exception for which Speingmvc doesn't find related exception handler method, then it would go and search for Generic exception handler method And if it finds then it would simply go and execute that. So the question is how we would add such method in the controller class?

```
@ExceptionHandler(value = Exception.class)
public String handleException(Exception e){
	System.out.println("IO unknown Occured: "+e);
	return "Exception";

}
```
##### /Exception.jsp

```
<%@ taglib prefix="form" uri="http://www.springframework.org/tags/form" %>
<%@ taglib prefix="spring" uri="http://www.springframework.org/tags" %>
<html>
<head>
<title>success</title>
</head>
<body>

	<h1>${headerMsg}</h1>
	<h1>STUDENT ADMISSION FORM FOR ENGINEERING COURSE</h1>
	
	<p>The application has encountered a unknown error. Please contact support by sending an email at webmaster@dac.com</p>

</body>
</html>
```

## Exception Handling 02

Guys The only drawback what approach you learn so far is an exception handler method is applicable only to the controller class, where it is present and it is not be applied or used by the framework for exceptions thrown by other controller classes so what it means?

Let's say in your application you have 10 controller classes and for each controller class, you want to handle  NullPointerException with this approach you will need to include an exception handler method for  NullPointerException in each of 10 controller classes separately.


So the kind of approve we have learned so far we might end up by adding a lot of redundant exceptionHandler methods in our controller classes. 
So is there any way that we could write an exception handler method for NullPointerException, Only at one place applies to all controller classes which are present in the application?

Yes, there is a way?
SpringMVC says hey developers you include a class in your application with `@ControllerAdvice` annotation on top of it. Then whatever exception handler methods you put in such class all those would be applied to all controller classes which stays in the application.

##### /GlobalExceptionHandlerMethods.java
```

@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandlerMethods {

	@ExceptionHandler(value = NullPointerException.class)
	public String handleNullPointerException(Exception e) {
		// logging Null Pointer Exception
		System.out.println("Null Pointer Exception Occured: " + e);
		return "NullPointerException";
	}

	@ExceptionHandler(value = IOException.class)
	public String handleIoException(Exception e) {
		System.out.println("IO Exception Occured: " + e);
		return "IOException";
	}

	@ExceptionHandler(value = Exception.class)
	public String handleException(Exception e) {
		System.out.println("IO unknown Occured: " + e);
		return "Exception";

	}
	
}
```

###### Important point: 
If you observer each method in this class what you are doing we are first logging information, thrown exception and then returning view name.

This is what we are doing in all exception handler methods.

Now SpringMVC says hey developers if you have to perform just these to task in each exception handler method then you really don't need to write such big java class in your application and you can perform all such handling task by writing a very simple bean definition in your spring configuration file.

#### /dispatcher-servlet.xml
```

<bean id="simpleMappingExceptionResolver" 
	class="org.springframework.web.servlet.handler.SimpleMappingExceptionResolver">
		<property name="exceptionMappings">
			<map>
				<entry key="NullPointerException" value="NullPointerException"/>
				<entry key="IOException" value="IOException"/>
			</map>
		</property>
		
		<!-- This is the default error webpage on the generic error webpage -->
		<property name="defaultErrorView" value="Exception"/>
		
		<!-- Name of logger to use to log exception unset by default, so logging disabled -->
		<property name="warnLogCategory" value="MVClogger"/>
		
</bean>

```

SO this bean definition is exactly doing the same thing as what `GlobalExceptionHandlerMethods` class is performing.

let me explain,


With this bean definition, we are instruction SpringMVC hey SpringMVC when any of the controller class throw a NullPointerException just return `NullPointerException` view name exactly like`handleNullPointerException(Exception e)`  exception handling method. And IoException thrown by any of the controller class in application just return `IOException` view name. exactly like `handleIoException(Exception e)` this exception handling method. and when any of the controller class throw some exception which is not present in this above bean definition. just return as `defaultErrorView` and `exception` view name. Exactly like `handleException(Exception e)` this exception handling method.

Now if you observe we are logging info of thrown exception before returning view name. that's something we are doing with the help of belove property definition `warnLogCategory` with this we are instructing SpringMVC hey SpringMVC before returning customized view page to the client's browser just log the info of the thrown exception exactly we are going in each exception handler method.
