## Web Services 03 (HTTP PUT, @RequestBody, Content-Type)

How to develop those kind of REST API's which would demand clients to make the `HTTP PUT` kind of request on them and in addition to that We are also going to talk about the use of `@RequestBody` annotation as well as the `Content-type` request header.


### Question:

In what scenarios you want to develop a REST API which demands `GET` & `PUT` type of request to be made on them?

GET - Where you want to clients to read some data which is available on the server side.

PUT - Where you want clients to update certain information which is kept on the server side.

### Requirement:

Here my requirement is client should be able to modify a specific student's record Which is present at the server side.

So I want to basically develop below REST API which I want to give the clients so that The client would make a `PUT` request on this REST API.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35020560/59968286-d97ab580-9554-11e9-8e8f-02f03522becb.png)


And in this REST API itself clients would need to specify the `name` of the student which they want to modify at the server side and along with the request.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35020560/59968291-f2836680-9554-11e9-8be6-9f908f1dd61a.png)


The client would also need to specify the information may be in the `JSON` format or in the `XML` format which they want to update which corresponds to this particular student at the server side.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35020560/59968296-1f377e00-9555-11e9-91e5-694c8c665497.png)


Now i am going to make a `PUT` request on this REST API with this information what's going to happen The request goes to reach this rest API controller.

```
@RequestMapping(value= "/student/{name}", method=RequestMethod.PUT)
		 public boolean updateStudent(@PathVariable("name") String studentName,@RequestBody Student student) {
         }
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35020560/59968597-98d16b00-9559-11e9-8e0a-c33308bf0c16.png)

But here the problem is for @RequestBody annotation to work means to map this information to the properties of student object this need to know in what format that info has sent by the client so for this work properly client also needs to sent information about in what format he has specified this info along with the request.

Here we have specified info in `JSON` format so here I would need to include a header with Key as `content-type` with its value as `application/JSON`.

## Web Services 03 (@RequestMapping using Consumes)

### Requirement:
What if we have a very specific requirement that we want below REST API controller method to support only one format Means here we want to restrict the client to specify input information in only one format. 

So how to do that?

```
@RequestMapping(value= "/student/{name}", method=RequestMethod.PUT)
public boolean updateStudent(@PathVariable("name") String studentName,@RequestBody Student student) {
   System.out.println("Student Name: "+studentName);
   System.out.println("Student Name: "+student.getName() +"Student Hobby: "+student.getHobby());
   return true;
}
```

Let's say we want this REST API controller method to work in only those cases when the client is specifying input information message in `XML` format only.

That can be achieved by making use of `consumes` argument with `@RequestMapping` annotation. So how it works, let's understand that?

```
@RequestMapping(value= "/student/{name}", method=RequestMethod.PUT,consumes= MediaType.APPLICATION_XML_VALUE)
```
Because of this `consumes` argument, We have restricted this REST API controller method to work for only those Where a client has specified the message in the only `XML` format.

This is going to find out that a message has come in any other format other than `XML` Then it's going to simply throw an error it's not going to work so this is the kind of restriction we have imposed using `consumes` argument with request mapping annotation.

```
 @RequestMapping(value= "/student/{name}", method=RequestMethod.PUT,consumes= MediaType.APPLICATION_XML_VALUE)
 public boolean updateStudent(@PathVariable("name") String studentName,@RequestBody Student student) {
	System.out.println("Student Name: "+studentName);
	System.out.println("Student Name: "+student.getName() +"Student Hobby: "+student.getHobby());
			 
	// find the matching student record using "StudentName" from the DB
	// update the matching student record with the information of student sent by the client
	 // return true if update is successfully done and return false if update is not done successfully
	 return true;
 }

```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35020560/59972353-1ffaff00-95ab-11e9-8b8c-55fbb8f63207.png)

JSON:
```
	@RequestMapping(value = "/student/{name}", method = RequestMethod.PUT, consumes = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
	public boolean updateStudent(@PathVariable("name") String studentName, @RequestBody Student student) {

		System.out.println("Student Name: " + studentName);
		System.out.println("Student Name: " + student.getName() + "Student Hobby: " + student.getHobby());

		// find the matching student record using "StudentName" from the DB
		// update the matching student record with the information of student sent by
		// the client
		// return true if update is successfully done and return false if update is not
		// done successfully

		return true;
	}
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35020560/59972364-47ea6280-95ab-11e9-9430-9889b89e42f7.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35020560/59972369-5769ab80-95ab-11e9-837d-127bd24fe23a.png)


Now the interesting point which you should note down over here is This application isn't just sending the response body in the response message But along with the response body, it sends two more important information to the client. 
1) Response Headers - a bunch of key value pairs. 
2) Response status code


So in the response message application sends response body, response headers & response status code.

Guys first we concentrate on status code as well as the response body.

### Question: 

*What this status code is all about?*


Guys, whatever status code an application is sent in the response that Informs client about what has happened while processing its request on the server. Was that request successfully processed by the application or while processing that request. Application somewhere failed in between so whatever has happened to that request while processing it at the server side that's what an application describes by sending an aggregate status code the client So the different status code value can be a different information to the client.

##### Here are some status codes with their meaning:

200 OK : CLient's request is successfully processed by the server.
404  Not Found : whatever resource client has specified withing the request message, that's not available at the server.
500 Internal server Error : SOme Unexpected error has occured while processing client's request at the server.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35020560/59972369-5769ab80-95ab-11e9-837d-127bd24fe23a.png)

In above response message we are getting Response body and the status code and both of these are conveyed same kind of information to me It's not that after looking at status code I would be looking at in response body or after looking at response body I would be looking at status code.Because both are conveying me the same kind of information nothing special.

In response body when I say true, I would understand that This request must have been successfully processed at the server. And the same is that the status code is conveying to me.

###### So why to send two things in the response message we just conveying same information to the client So you can send either of these two?

Here what important point you need to understand is, in general developers around the globe prefer Sending status code for `PUT` kind of REST API's than sending response body,So what they prefer is they do not send response body With such kind of request they send the appropriate status code which best describes the situation.

```

@RequestMapping(value = "/student/{name}", method = RequestMethod.PUT, consumes = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
public void updateStudent(@PathVariable("name") String studentName, @RequestBody Student student) {

	System.out.println("Student Name: " + studentName);
	System.out.println("Student Name: " + student.getName() + "Student Hobby: " + student.getHobby());

}
	 
```

So now when you have decided that you are going to only send an appropriate Status code and you are not going to send the response body then another The problem arises.

The problem is when you make a request and the request is being processed by this REST API Controller method and let's say while processing it doesn't throw any exception and it reaches the end of this controller method and it comes out this controller method. So in all such cases REST API controller method, process the request without throwing any exception in between and reaches to them and comes out of the controller method The application assumes that everything has gone right while processing that request. And in all such cases it returns `200 OK` as status code Which sometimes you do not want to happen.

E.g. important case where you don't want application to send `200 OK` status code.

In below code application is not able to find out `dipak` record in the database. So in this case, what's going to do well, nothing special it's not going to update `dipak` record with request information So here exception will not occur and the application will send 200 OK responses to the client and that's something really wrong.

```
	@RequestMapping(value = "/student/{name}", method = RequestMethod.PUT, consumes = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
	public void updateStudent(@PathVariable("name") String studentName, @RequestBody Student student) {

		System.out.println("Student Name: " + studentName);
		System.out.println("Student Name: " + student.getName() + "Student Hobby: " + student.getHobby());

	}
```

It should send any other appropriate status code which best describes the situation and this can be best describes by sending the status code values `404 Not Found` by this response client can simply understand whatever the record, he went to update this is not available at the server.

###### So how you can send an appropriate status code within this REST API controller method depending upon Whatever logic you have returned inside it?

WE can achieve this by making use of something called as `ResponseEntity<Void>` return type.

```

	@RequestMapping(value = "/student/{name}", method = RequestMethod.PUT, consumes = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
	public ResponseEntity<Void> updateStudent(@PathVariable("name") String studentName, @RequestBody Student student) {

		System.out.println("Student Name: " + studentName);
		System.out.println("Student Name: " + student.getName() + "Student Hobby: " + student.getHobby());

		// find the matching student record using "StudentName" from the DB
		// update the matching student record with the information of student sent by
		// the client
		// return true if update is successfully done and return false if update is not
		// done successfully

		return new ResponseEntity<Void>(HttpStatus.OK);
	}

```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35020560/59973671-6018ac80-95c0-11e9-9eea-16269c3cf7cc.png)


If the record is not found, then need to change it to `ResponseEntity(HttpStatus. NOT_FOUND)` So in this case this rest api controller method is going to send status As `404 Not Found`.

```
	@RequestMapping(value = "/student/{name}", method = RequestMethod.PUT, consumes = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
	public ResponseEntity<Void> updateStudent(@PathVariable("name") String studentName, @RequestBody Student student) {

		System.out.println("Student Name: " + studentName);
		System.out.println("Student Name: " + student.getName() + "Student Hobby: " + student.getHobby());

		// find the matching student record using "StudentName" from the DB
		// update the matching student record with the information of student sent by
		// the client
		// return true if update is successfully done and return false if update is not
		// done successfully

		return new ResponseEntity<Void>(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
	}
```

### Requirement: In Real time scenario you decide to send response body as well in addition status code. Then how to achieve that? 

Using `ResponseEntity` we can achieve this very easily lets say you want to send here true as response body in addition to this status code.

```

	@RequestMapping(value = "/student/{name}", method = RequestMethod.PUT, consumes = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
	public ResponseEntity<Boolean> updateStudent(@PathVariable("name") String studentName, @RequestBody Student student) {

		System.out.println("Student Name: " + studentName);
		System.out.println("Student Name: " + student.getName() + "Student Hobby: " + student.getHobby());

		// find the matching student record using "StudentName" from the DB
		// update the matching student record with the information of student sent by
		// the client
		// return true if update is successfully done and return false if update is not
		// done successfully

		return new ResponseEntity<Boolean>(true,HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
	}

```

The whole idea is when you pass only one argument to response entity object then that The argument is considered as the response status to be sent to the client. And when you pass two arguments to response entity object in that case ResponseEntity Is going to consider the first argument as response body and the second argument as response status. Whatever type of response body we are passing here as the first argument same type you have to specify here `ResponseEntity<Boolean>` 

## Web Services 03 (HTTP Response Headers and ResponseEntity for a REST API)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35020560/60122913-e214fb00-97a3-11e9-853b-f991149decec.png)


Guys, if you look at the overall response what server has sent to me for above request I would find that it has sent me body, status as well as some bunch of key value pairs under the header tag.

Now what are these key value pairs in general developer call's this key value pair as HTTP response headers.
So the question is what are these key value pairs and why server has sent these key value pairs to me? For above request in the response.

The answer is these key value pairs simply describes the overall response message in the most appropriate manner Let me explain you the importance of this key value pair one by one.

`content-type →application/json;charset=UTF-8`

After looking at the value of content-type key a client would be able to understand in what format response body has come to it. It's in JSON format, XML format or any other format.

Well by looking at the `content-type →application/json;charset=UTF-8` client is sure of one thing that a response body is actually in JSON format.

` date →Tue, 25 Jun 2019 17:32:35 GMT`

This key value pair describes at what date and time this response was produced by the server.

`Server →Apache-Coyote/1.1`

This one simply talks about what kind of web server has produced this response.

`transfer-encoding →chunked`

This pair talks about what kind of encoding technique has been used to transfer this response from the server to the client.


#### There are so many HTTP response headers available some of the important ones are listed below along with their meaning.

Cache-Contro -> Tells all caching mechanisms from server to client whether they may cache this object. it is measured in seconds.

Content-Encoding -> The type of encoding used on the data

Content-Languages -> The natural languages of the intended audience for the enclosed content.

Content - Loncation -> An alternate location for the returned data.

Refresh -> Used in redirection, or when a new resurce gas been created.This refresh redirects after 5 seconds.

To above request by default, this server has sent me these four key value pairs now in different circumstances and situations your server may decide to include appropriate HTTP headers along with the response message.

#### As an Application developer what if you want to add your own customized HTTP header along with the response from within a REST API controller method. You don't want to depend on server to choose an appropriate HTTP Header and include the same within the response message you would have a control over it You want to specify response HTTP header from within the REST API controller method?

```
	@RequestMapping(value = "/student2/{name}", method = RequestMethod.PUT, consumes = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
	public ResponseEntity<Boolean> updateStudent2(@PathVariable("name") String studentName, @RequestBody Student student) 	    {

		System.out.println("Student Name: " + studentName);
		System.out.println("Student Name: " + student.getName() + "Student Hobby: " + student.getHobby());

		HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
		headers.add("Key1", "Value1");
		headers.add("Key2", "Value2");
		headers.add("Key3", "Value3");	
		
		return new ResponseEntity<Boolean>(false,headers,HttpStatus.OK);
	}
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35020560/60123574-6025d180-97a5-11e9-9bbe-75f3e71a36ae.png)

So, in addition to these default key value pairs server has now sent these customized HTTP Headers what we specified over here, So overall concept guys when you pass a single argument to the `ResponseEntity` constructor it considers that argument as HTTP status, and when you pass two arguments, it considers the first argument as response body and second as response status, And when we pass three arguments to it, it considers first as a response body, second as HTTP headers, and third ones as response HTTP status.

## How to build HTTP POST REST APIs?

When and how to develop those kind of REST API's which would demand `POST` kind of request?

Guys in general, when we go on developing `GET` type of REST API in only those kind of cases When certain resource is present on the server and you want to user to read that resource.
In the similar manner when you want to develop `PUT` kind of REST API in only those kind of cases when a certain resource is present on the server and you want to user make a request To update that resource with certain information what the user is supposed to be sending along with the request.

##### In the similar manner question arises from `POST` kind of REST API so, in what scenarios you want to build the `POST` kind of REST API's?

Well the simple answer is you go for developing `POST` kind of REST API only these kind of cases when you want the user to make a request to create a new resource on the server.

##### Now what does creating a new resource means?
It just means that you want the user to send some new information to the server Which is not existing there so that later on a request could be made by using some other REST API to read that information.

##### Example:

Requirement:

I want is user to send a new student information record to the application. and the application should insert that record into the database so that later on This REST API can be used to read that student record?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35020560/60208291-8adf5b00-9875-11e9-9aa7-f9502d9b0c72.png)

Guys here what I would do, I would build below REST API and provide to all the users of this application. So when the user is going to make a `POST` kind of request on this REST API with the information of a new student record so when that request is going to reach to the application this application is simply going to insert that new student record into the database if it successfully able to insert It's going to return `true` in the response otherwise it's going to return `false`.

```

	@RequestMapping(value = "/addStudent", method = RequestMethod.POST, consumes = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
	public ResponseEntity<Boolean> postStudent(@RequestBody Student student) {
		System.out.println("Student Name: " + student.getName() + "Student Hobby: " + student.getHobby());
		// insert the student record into the database

		return new ResponseEntity<Boolean>(true, HttpStatus.OK);
	}

```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35020560/60208387-cda13300-9875-11e9-912b-672ffe7c1608.png)

Well, after inserting this record successfully into the database application is going to return true as response body and status code `200 Ok` see in the above response.

Now the important point is to understand is for the `POST` kind of REST API method.
Generally, when the request is successfully processed by the respective controller method developers do not send status code as `200 Ok` So instead of this they prefer sending some other status code `201 created`.

```
	@RequestMapping(value = "/addStudent", method = RequestMethod.POST, consumes = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
	public ResponseEntity<Boolean> postStudent(@RequestBody Student student) {
		System.out.println("Student Name: " + student.getName() + "Student Hobby: " + student.getHobby());
		// insert the student record into the database
		
		return new ResponseEntity<Boolean>(true, HttpStatus.CREATED);
	}
```

So now I am going to make a post request to the application I would receive below response.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35020560/60208657-75b6fc00-9876-11e9-93fe-eb00d22d15ff.png)


#### What is the difference between 200 OK and 201 created?
200 OK signifies that whatever request client has made to the server that the request is successful Processed. 
and 201 created signifies that whatever resource client wanted to create on the server that successfully created there. 

So its not too much difference between two it's just about the developer's preference, you choose to 201 created over 200 ok For such kind of REST API development.

One more concept is there:

```
	@RequestMapping(value = "/addStudent", method = RequestMethod.POST, consumes = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
	public ResponseEntity<Boolean> postStudent(@RequestBody Student student) {
		System.out.println("Student Name: " + student.getName() + "Student Hobby: " + student.getHobby());
		// insert the student record into the database

		HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
		headers.add("Location", 
					ServletUriComponentsBuilder.fromCurrentRequest()
					.path("/{name}")
					.buildAndExpand(student.getName()).toUri()
					.toString());
		
		return new ResponseEntity<Boolean>(true, headers,HttpStatus.CREATED);
	}
```
In the above image I have got `true` as the response body `201 created` as a status code and in addition these two I have also got `location →http: //localhost: 8081/SpringMVC_WebServices/addStudent/Rock2` this key value pair In the response as response headers.

Now what's this here this `headers.add("Location",ServletUriComponentsBuilder.fromCurrentRequest().path("/{name}").buildAndExpand(student.getName()).toUri().toString());` piece of code i have added.

This REST API controller method telling to the client whatever response it has just created that resource can be read By making a get request on this REST API that's it.

So the overall concept of what you have to note down here is when you develop `POST` kind of REST API controller method When it's successfully able to create the resource for that request them It should be sending the location in headers which that client can make use of to read that resource And also `201 created` is the status code what generally developers prefer to send in the response when the corresponding controller method is successfully able to process the request or successfully create the resource.

## How to build HTTP DELETE REST API's?

In general, we go for development, such kind of REST API in those kind of scenarios where Where we want the user to make a request to the application to delete a certain resource which is present there.

#### What does deleting resource means?

Requirement:

I want is user to make a request to this application to delete a specific student record.

```
		@RequestMapping(value = "/deleteStudent/{name}", method = RequestMethod.DELETE)
		public ResponseEntity<Boolean> deleteStudent(@PathVariable("name") String name) {
			System.out.println("Student Name: " + name);
			// delete the student record from the database
			
			return new ResponseEntity<Boolean>(true,HttpStatus.OK);
		}
```

##### Now if we want to give the user kind of flexibility to make a request to delete all students Records from this application?

```
				@RequestMapping(value = "/deleteAllStudent", method = RequestMethod.DELETE)
				public ResponseEntity<Boolean> deleteAllStudent() {
					
					// delete All students record from the database
					
					return new ResponseEntity<Boolean>(true,HttpStatus.OK);
				}
```
