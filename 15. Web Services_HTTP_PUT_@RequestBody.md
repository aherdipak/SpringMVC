## Web Services 03 (HTTP PUT, @RequestBody, Content-Type 01)

How to develop those kind of REST API's which would demand clients to make the `HTTP PUT` kind of request on them and in addition to that We are also going to talk about the use of `@RequestBody` annotation as well as the `Content-type` request header.


### Question:

In what scenarios you want to develop a REST API which demands `GET` & `PUT` type of request to be made on them?

GET - Where you want to clients to read some data which is available on the server side.

PUT - Where you want clients to update certain information which is kept on the server side.

### Requirement:

Here my requirement is client should be able to modify a specific student's record Which is present at the server side.

So I want to basically develop below REST API which I want to give the clients so that The client would make a `PUT` request on this REST API.

And in this REST API itself clients would need to specify the `name` of the student which they want to modify at the server side and along with the request.

The client would also need to specify the information may be in the `JSON` format or in the `XML` format which they want to update which corresponds to this particular student at the server side.
