## @InitBinder annotation, WebDataBinder, CustomDateEditor (concept) 

### Question ?
#### when I would submit form, I would expect spring mvc will bind all these form value expect student mobile form element's with the curresponding property of student object ?

we can achieve this by using two ways
```markdown
  1. @InitBinder annotation
  2. WebDataBinder
 ```

Spring mvc says whenever you want to customize data binding feature for a perticular controller class, then you add function in that class with the name of your choice but place  `@InitBinder` on top of that method and `WebDataBinder`  as it's method argument then whatever you want to custamise you simply go and doing that with the help of webDataBinder ref.

### \Student.java
```
public class Student {

	private String studentName;
	private String studenthobby;
	
	private Long mobileNumber;
	private Date dob;
	private List<String> skills;
  
  // setter & getter
}
```
