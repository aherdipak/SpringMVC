## @InitBinder annotation, WebDataBinder, CustomDateEditor (concept) 

### Question 1: 
#### when I would submit form, I would expect spring mvc will bind all these form value expect student mobile form element's with the curresponding property of student object ?

we can achieve this by using two ways
```markdown
  1. @InitBinder annotation
  2. WebDataBinder
 ```

Spring mvc says whenever you want to customize data binding feature for a perticular controller class, then you add function in that class with the name of your choice but place  `@InitBinder` on top of that method and `WebDataBinder`  as it's method argument then whatever you want to custamise you simply go and doing that with the help of webDataBinder ref.

##### \AdmissionController.java
```
@InitBinder
public void initBinder(WebDataBinder binder) {
	binder.setDisallowedFields(new String[] {"mobileNumber"});
}
```

### Question 2: 
#### We provide the date in the format yyyy/MM/DD. Now, whenever we submit form spring mvc bind studentDOB property value with Date property of student objects. If we provide date in some other format, then spring moves would fail. Now I would want to allow user to provide date in this format yyyy****MM****dd?

we can achieve this by using ` Property editor`

##### \AdmissionController.java
```
  @InitBinder
	public void initBinder(WebDataBinder binder) {
		binder.setDisallowedFields(new String[] {"mobileNumber"});
		SimpleDateFormat dateformat = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy****MM****dd");
		binder.registerCustomEditor(Date.class, new CustomDateEditor(dateformat, false));
	}
 ```
 
##### CustomDateEditor
SpringMVC internally uses a concept called the property editor in order to perform data binding class What exactly I mean in this spring MVC has many build in classes which it calls as property editor classes CustomDateEditor is one of such class eg. are `FileEditor, ClassEditor, CustomNumberEditor` etc. SpringMVC uses property editor class in oder to perform type conversion while performing data binding.

# 
## Writing your own custom property editor class

### Question 3: 

#### How I would write customise property editor clss?

spring MVC has given some property classes for us to use we can customize those classes as per our requirement but If you may not find any of these class suitable for your project requirement then what you will you do?

#### when the user would submit this for to spring MVC application before performing data binding task for this form application would check user has provided gender specification or not along with the name i.e Mr.ABC or Miss.ABC if the user provides gender before name then spring MVC will happily bind form element value with the student object.But the user has not provided gender specification then application by default give Miss. as gender specification.for this, I am not able to find any property editor class how would I achieve this?

##### \StudentNamePropertyEditor.java
```
import java.beans.PropertyEditorSupport;
public class StudentNamePropertyEditor extends  PropertyEditorSupport{

	// When you will submit the admission form ->
	// spring mvc will run setAsText function of this class -->
	// Before performing data binding task for studentName property of student object
	
	@Override
	public void setAsText(String studentName) {
		if(studentName.contains("Mr.") || studentName.contains("Ms.")) {
			setValue(studentName);
		}else {
			studentName = "Ms."+studentName;
			setValue(studentName); 
			// what every value you will provide to setValue -- spring MVC will use the
			// same value to perform data binding task for studentName property
		}
	}
}
```

##### \AdmissionController.java
```
@InitBinder
public void initBinder(WebDataBinder binder) {
		binder.setDisallowedFields(new String[] {"mobileNumber"});
		
		SimpleDateFormat dateformat = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy*MM*dd");
		binder.registerCustomEditor(Date.class,"dob", new CustomDateEditor(dateformat, false));
		
		binder.registerCustomEditor(String.class,"studentName", new StudentNamePropertyEditor());
		
		//CustomDateEditor
		// spring mvc internally uses concept called property editor in oder to perform data binding class
		// what exactly i mean by this is  spring mvc has many build in classes which it calls as property editor classes
		// CustomDateEditor is one of such class
		// Ex. aare   fileEditor,classEditor,customNumber editor etc
		// spring mvc uses property editor class in oder to perform type conversion while performing data binding
	}
```
