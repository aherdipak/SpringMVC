## @InitBinder annotation, WebDataBinder, CustomDateEditor (concept) 

### Question 1: 
#### when I would submit form, I would expect spring mvc will bind all these form value expect student mobile form element's with the curresponding property of student object ?

we can achieve this by using two ways
```markdown
  1. @InitBinder annotation
  2. WebDataBinder
 ```

Spring mvc says whenever you want to customize data binding feature for a perticular controller class, then you add function in that class with the name of your choice but place  `@InitBinder` on top of that method and `WebDataBinder`  as it's method argument then whatever you want to custamise you simply go and doing that with the help of webDataBinder ref.

### \Student.java
```
@InitBinder
public void initBinder(WebDataBinder binder) {
	binder.setDisallowedFields(new String[] {"mobileNumber"});
}
```

### Question 2: 
#### We provide the date in the format yyyy/MM/DD. Now, whenever we submit form spring mvc bind studentDOB property value with Date property of student objects. If we provide date in some other format, then spring moves would fail. Now I would want to allow user to provide date in this format yyyy****MM****dd?

we can achieve this by using ` Property editor`
```
  @InitBinder
	public void initBinder(WebDataBinder binder) {
		binder.setDisallowedFields(new String[] {"mobileNumber"});
		SimpleDateFormat dateformat = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy****MM****dd");
		binder.registerCustomEditor(Date.class, new CustomDateEditor(dateformat, false));
	}
 ```
 
`CustomDateEditor`
SpringMVC internally uses a concept called the property editor in order to perform data binding class What exactly I mean in this spring MVC has many build in classes which it calls as property editor classes CustomDateEditor is one of such class eg. are `FileEditor, ClassEditor, CustomNumberEditor` etc. SpringMVC uses property editor class in oder to perform type conversion while performing data binding.
